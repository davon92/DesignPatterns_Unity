# Game Design Patterns in Unity

Welcome! This repo is a hands-on learning and demo space for core software engineering design patterns applied through the lens of **game development**.

Each folder contains a **microgame or prototype** demonstrating one pattern, implemented in:
- **Unity (C#)**

## ðŸ“š Patterns Covered

Patterns are grouped by category:

- **Creational**  
  Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype

- **Structural**  
  Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy

- **Behavioral**  
  Observer, Command, Strategy, State, Mediator, Memento, Visitor, Iterator, Chain of Responsibility

## ðŸ§­ Learning Goals

- Reinforce foundational programming principles
- Build a library of reusable gameplay architecture patterns
- Demonstrate cross-engine fluency

## ðŸ”§ Usage

Each pattern folder contains:
- ðŸ“„ `README.md` â€“ concept explanation + usage in games
- ðŸŽ® Unity project
- ðŸ“¦ Core scripts/classes

## ðŸš§ In Progress
